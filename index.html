            <p><em>By W. Wade DeVinney</em></p>
            <hr>
            <p>When the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau filed a lawsuit in 2017 against the student loan servicer Navient, it renewed discussion surrounding student loan practices in America and borrowers’ struggles to repay their debts. And while complaints regarding repayment issues did surge in the years leading up to the lawsuit, the CFPB’s data shows that the most common complaint against Navient was with their interactions with the lender.</p>
            <p>Examining the consumer written complaints reveals a lack of communication from Navient to its customers and a worrying lack of understanding on how loans work from customer support representatives. One borrower from New Hampshire wrote that customer service refused to speak with her when she was in forbearance, and she could not access her account online. She said when she exited forbearance, she was inundated with multiple emails from Navient, each claiming she owed a different amount of money. Another borrower, this one from Washington, wrote that she was trying to re-certify her student loans, but Navient repeatedly insisted that she needed the signature of her ex-husband to do so, mistaking her student loans for a spousal consolidation loan.</p>
            <p>As a part of a settlement reached between Navient and 39 state attorneys general in a following lawsuit, the servicer must better train customer representatives on how to help borrowers with their payments. Additionally, Navient agreed to clearly state the benefits of alternative payment plans that would reduce monthly liability without increasing interest. While communication and customer service were not the CFPB’s top issues with Navient, a wave of complaints led attorneys to compel the company to fix their issues.</p>
